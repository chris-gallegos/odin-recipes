    <h4>A hearty chicken noodle soup perfect for a cold day or a sick little one.</h4>

    <p>What’s so great about making chicken noodle soup from scratch when you could just open a can and call it dinner? 
        Well, aside from the fact that your family will love the way it tastes (who doesn’t love chicken noodle soup?), 
        you can feel good that you’re feeding them a home cooked meal full of the good stuff (and no weird chemicals or preservatives). 
        Chicken broth, veggies, some dried herbs, a store-bought rotisserie chicken and some egg noodles are all it takes to feed your family 
        a meal full of flavor, nutrition and love. Yeah, you got this!
