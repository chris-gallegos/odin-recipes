Hello everyone. This is my first HTML project following The Odin Project course.
I have learned the basic commands on Git and how to push work to GitHub.
I was able to put links on my Index.html page to my 3 recipe pages I created. 
The pages are basic HTML, however it was a great assignment to just get familiar with HTML syntax and git workflow. 
The skills I was able to refine were; adding links and images to my page, organizing text in a numbered link and unnumbered line.
